# Logical Volume Management (LVM) in Linux

This document outlines my hands-on experience working with Logical Volume Management in Linux, a flexible storage management system.

## What is LVM?

LVM (Logical Volume Management) provides a layer of abstraction between physical storage devices and filesystems. It offers several advantages:

1. **Flexibility** - Volumes can be resized without unmounting
2. **Snapshots** - Point-in-time copies of data for backup
3. **Stripping** - Data can span multiple physical disks
4. **Mirroring** - Data can be duplicated for redundancy

## Basic LVM Architecture

LVM consists of three main components:

- **Physical Volumes (PV)** - The actual physical storage devices
- **Volume Groups (VG)** - A pool of storage created from physical volumes
- **Logical Volumes (LV)** - Virtual partitions created from volume groups

## Commands and Examples

### Creating Physical Volumes

```bash
# Create a physical volume
sudo pvcreate /dev/loop1

# Display physical volume information
sudo pvdisplay
